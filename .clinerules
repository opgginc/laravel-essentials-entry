This package is a collection of frequently used Laravel packages for our company's projects, bundled together for easy use, updates, and management.

## Laravel Package Development Guideline

- Add `use` statements for all Facade classes to call them more concisely.
- Use Facade classes or original Laravel classes in all files instead of helper functions.
- Create new class and refactor if the file is getting too long. (more than 300 lines)
- Use `env()` instead of `Config` facade in config file. (`/config/essentials-entry.php`)
  - They don't support most classes in Laravel.
  - They support some of helpers: `storage_path()`, `resource_path()`, `env()`
  - They support some classes: `Illuminate\Support\Str`
- After every modification of `/config/essentials-entry.php`, check and modify `ConfigValidator`.

## Features

- When generating static files like `sitemap.xml` or `robots.txt`, save them to Cache and load them from there.

## Documentation Guidelines

- Document all public methods and classes with PHPDoc annotations.
- Include `@param`, `@return`, and `@throws` tags for all methods.
- Include examples of usage for complex methods.
- Document configuration options with sample values and explanations.
- Keep documentation up-to-date when changing functionality.
- Use descriptive variable and method names to improve self-documentation.
- Add inline comments for complex logic explaining the "why" not just the "what".
- Create markdown documentation for end-users in the docs/ directory.
- Include version compatibility information in all documentation.
- Document breaking changes prominently in CHANGELOG.md and README.md.
- Add type hints and return types to all methods for better IDE support.
- Document expected environment variables and their purposes.
- Maintain a FAQ section in the documentation for common issues.
- Document how the package integrates with Laravel's existing features.
- All the comments and documents should be written in Korean.
- Never numbering comments. For example, write `// Text` instead of `// 1. Text`.
